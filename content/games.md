I love playing video games in my spare time. I've easily spent the most time with strategy and city builders
(Civilization, Age of Empires, etc.), but also enjoy roguelike, puzzle, and adventure games. Here are some of my recent
favorites:

#### 2020

- Hollow Knight
- Ori and the Blind Forest
- Ori and the Will of the Wisps
- Celeste

#### 2019

- Deep Rock Galactic
- ISLANDERS
- Subnautica
