Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a software engineer at [Affirm](https://affirm.com/) in New York City.
I work on the infrastructure team. We support many of the company's live flows, including
caching, routing, CDNs, async tasks, application configuration, and secrets management.

I studied computer science at UT Austin and I've done internships at [Koddi](https://koddi.com/) and
[WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/).

In my free time, you can catch me practicing the violin, playing video games, and cooking.
Feel free to [say hi](mailto:benjamin.porter@utexas.edu) or take a look around!
