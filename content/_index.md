Hi! I'm Ben. I'm a software engineer based out of Austin, TX. I'm currently at [Affirm](https://affirm.com/), where
I work on the infrastructure team. We maintain many of the underlying frameworks that power our online flows, including
config and secrets management, distributed caching (Redis), traffic management (NGINX, Istio, CDNs), and async tasks
(Celery/RabbitMQ).
Some of my past projects have included scaling out our caching infrastructure to handle higher load and improving self
service flows for our secrets management system.

I went to school at UT Austin and I've done internships at [Koddi](https://koddi.com/) and
[WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/).
In my free time, you can catch me practicing the violin, playing video games, and cooking.
Feel free to [say hi](mailto:benjamin.porter@utexas.edu) or take a look around!
