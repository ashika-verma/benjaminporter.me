Hi! I'm Ben. I'm a junior studying computer science and a [Turing Scholar](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars)
at the University of Texas at Austin, minoring in business.

I'm interested in backend development, system scalability/reliability, and security. My work experience and classes have
given me a good foundation in these areas, and I'm always eager to learn more!

I've recently started exploring network security, primarily exploring it through the lens of the browser. It's a
fascinating field that's ever relevant, and it's introduced me to some of the most clever applications of programming
I've ever seen. I compete in biweekly capture-the-flag contests hosted by [ISSS](https://isss.io), a security org at UT.

Last summer, I interned at [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com), implementing an error-tolerant approach to synchronizing
invoices between the billing and accounting services used at the company.
I also worked at [Parasol Laboratory](https://parasol.tamu.edu) several years ago, doing research in robotics and
computational biology.

Feel free to check out the links above or send me an email if you want to get in touch with me.
