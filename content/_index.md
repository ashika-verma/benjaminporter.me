Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a software engineer at [Affirm](https://affirm.com/) in New York City.
I work on the infrastructure team, and some past projects have dealt with Redis caching, secrets management,
and edge traffic routing.

I studied computer science at UT Austin and I've done internships at [Koddi](https://koddi.com/) and
[WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/). In both of these roles, I worked with setting up Go microservices to replace legacy systems.

In my free time, you can catch me 🎻 practicing the violin, 🎮 playing video games, 🍳 cooking, or 🧗 using my
height to gain an unfair advantage at the climbing gym.
Feel free to [say hi](mailto:benjamin.porter@utexas.edu) or take a look around!
