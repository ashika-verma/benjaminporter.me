Hi! I'm Ben. I'm a junior studying computer science and a [Turing Scholar](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars)
at the University of Texas at Austin, minoring in business.

I'm interested in networking and computer security. I compete in biweekly capture-the-flag contests hosted by
[ISSS](https://isss.io), a security org. This semester, I'm taking computer networking and network security
courses.

Last summer, I interned at [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com), working on the billing system and developing an
error-tolerant approach to synchronize invoices between the services we use. I also worked at 
[Parasol Laboratory](https://parasol.tamu.edu) several years ago, doing research in robotics and computational biology.

Feel free to check out the links above or send me an email if you want to get in touch with me.
