Music is a really important part of my life. I started playing the violin in 5th grade and was in the orchestra all the
way through high school. It was a constant source of community and great friendships. We got to take several out of
state trips as a group and perform at places like Carnegie Hall.

Here are some of my favorite classical pieces:

- Violin Concerto No. 1 in G Minor, Max Bruch
- Violin Concerto No. 1 in A Minor, Jean-Baptiste Accolay
- Tragic Overture, Johannes Brahms
- Egmont Overture, Ludwig van Beethoven
- Night on Bald Mountain, Modest Mussorgsky
- Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, Ralph Vaughn Williams
- Capriol Suite, Peter Warlock
